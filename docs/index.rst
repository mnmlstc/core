Overview
========

MNMLSTC Core is a C++11 library that adds several library features that are to
be included in C++14 and beyond. A majority of the components of MNMLSTC Core
can also be found in Boost. However, there are distinct behaviorial differences
that are outlined and discussed in this documentation.

It is recommended that new users read :doc:`usage`. The documentation is
ordered according to the augmented library components, rather than by feature.

For those who are looking for a specific section in the documentation, having a
glance at the :ref:`Generated Index<genindex>` might be of assistance.

A :ref:`search<search>` feature is also available.
